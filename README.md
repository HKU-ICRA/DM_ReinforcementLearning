# DM_ReinforcementLearning
This repository contains code to train multi-agent environments for decision making via reinforcement learning. 

# Common algorithms
The following algorithms are well-known in the reinforcement-learning community and serves as a baseline for benchmarking our research algorithms:

| Algorithms | Multi-agent? | Past simple env? | Viewer? | Multi-env? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PPO | ☑ | ☐ | ☑ | ☐ |
| DDPG | ☑ | ☑<sup>1</sup> | ☑ | ☐ |
<sup>1</sup>Normal noise diverges but OU works perfectly fine

# Research algorithms
The following algorithms are specifically tailored to our tasks:
